With industrial energy management taken to the forefront of operational efficiency, the absolute significance of precise estimates for energy consumption is more intense. In this paper, we propose a dual-model machine learning approach to predict energy consumption for a small steel industry in South Korea using 15-minute-chronicled data. We have used two Random Forest Regressor models that implement both short and long term needs of forecasting. The first model utilizes a set of operational features to predict energy consumption for every 15-minute window and hence would be useful for realtime optimization of energy. The second model uses time series analysis; it only depends on date and time-based features to predict the future daily energy consumption. This model accepts a custom date range as input and gives day-wise predictions, which is visualized as a time series plot. Both the models have been so implemented and tested for prediction accuracy. Highly accurate prediction of interval-specific loads with the help of the feature-based model, whereas the time series model assures reliably to forecast aggregate consumption of the day for strategic energy planning. Our results also establish usefulness for forecasting using Random Forests in smart industrial environments as an efficient and sustainable means of energy consumption management.
